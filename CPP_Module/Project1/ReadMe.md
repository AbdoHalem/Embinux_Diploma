# Project Overview:
I developed a menu-driven C++ program that allows users to manage Bluetooth and WiFi connections seamlessly on a Linux system. Key features include:

## WiFi Controls: 
1- Display WiFi status (On/Off)
2- Turn WiFi On/Off
3- Connect to a WiFi network (saved or new)
4- Save and manage WiFi networks (with options to modify or remove saved networks)
5- Search for a network by SSID

## Bluetooth Controls: 
1-Display Bluetooth status (On/Off)
2-Turn Bluetooth On/Off
3- Scan for and connect to available Bluetooth devices

💻 Tech Stack:

C++ for logic and system commands integration
nmcli and bluetoothctl commands to control network interfaces on Linux
Modular approach using .cpp and .hpp files for clean and efficient code management
This project not only helped me sharpen my C++ skills but also allowed me to explore how system-level control and interaction can be implemented through code.

𝐇𝐢𝐧𝐭: This code is applicaple for pure linux machine not virtual box.
