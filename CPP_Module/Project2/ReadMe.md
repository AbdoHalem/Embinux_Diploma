# Vehicle Telemetry and Diagnostic System Simulation Project

## Project Description:
A customer has a car and wants to measure its telemetries and control its system.
This vehicle is equipped with state-of-the-art sensors and systems designed to ensure safe and efficient operation under various driving conditions.

## Sensors:
SpeedSensor: Simulates the vehicle's speed.
RadarSensor: Tracks Radar distance for obstacle detection.
TemperatureSensor: Monitors the engine's temperature.
Battery: Display the battery's charge level and temperature.

## ECUs:
AdaptiveCruiseControl: changes speed or break when temperature or obstacale detection happens.

## Diagnostics:
Regularly check all monitored parameters, identify any potential 
issues (such as low fuel, excessive speed, overheating, low battery 
charge, or unsafe proximity to another vehicle)

## Logger:
Single instance logger to be used among all the classes for logging
